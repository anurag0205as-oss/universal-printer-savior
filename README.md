Unlock the "Service Required" error on your Epson EcoTank printer in seconds. No trial keys, no hardware swaps, no proprietary software required.

## Features
- **One-Click Unlock**: Reset Waste Ink Pad counters in seconds.
- **RAW Protocol**: Uses low-level Windows Spooler communication (Direct & Safe).
- **Universal Support**: L3110, L3150, L4150, and 50+ other models.
- **Zero Cost**: Built for the community, by the community.

## How to Use
1.  Download the latest [Release](https://github.com/your-username/universal-printer-savior/releases).
2.  Connect your printer via USB.
3.  Run the application.
4.  Select your printer and click **Reset**.

## Why this exists?
Proprietary "Reset Keys" are a scam. Your printer is yours; you shouldn't have to pay to use it after a certain number of prints. This tool uses the standard maintenance protocol to clear the software lock.

**Disclaimer**: Use this at your own risk. Ensure your physical waste ink pads are checked if you reset the counter multiple times.
