## Why this exists?
Proprietary "Reset Keys" are a scam. Your printer is yours; you shouldn't have to pay to use it after a certain number of prints. This tool uses the standard maintenance protocol to clear the software lock.

**Disclaimer**: Use this at your own risk. Ensure your physical waste ink pads are checked if you reset the counter multiple times.
