## [0:00 - 0:15] The Hook
**(Visual: Show a printer with blinking red lights and the 'Service Required' message on the PC screen.)**
> "Your Epson printer is blinking red lights and saying 'Service Required'? Don't throw it away and don't pay $50 for a repair. I’m going to show you how to fix this in exactly 60 seconds using a tool that actually works in 2026."

## [0:15 - 0:45] The Problem
**(Visual: Close up of the error message.)**
> "This happens because of the waste ink pad counter. It’s just a software lock. Most 'adjustment programs' online are old or full of viruses. But today, we're using the Universal Printer Savior."

## [0:45 - 1:30] The Solution (The Demo)
**(Visual: Screen recording of the Universal_Printer_Savior.exe being opened.)**
> "Step 1: Download the tool from the link in the description. 
> Step 2: Connect your printer via USB. 
> Step 3: Enter your Hardware ID to get your Activation Key. 
> Step 4: Click 'Reset Waste Ink Counter'. 
> And... done! Look at the printer now."
**(Visual: Printer lights stop blinking, green light stays solid.)**

## [1:30 - 2:00] The Call to Action
**(Visual: Show the Vercel website and the $9.99 price.)**
> "The tool supports 24+ Epson and Canon models. It’s a lifetime license for just $9.99—much cheaper than buying a new printer or paying for single-use keys. Download it now at the link below and get back to printing. Peace!"
